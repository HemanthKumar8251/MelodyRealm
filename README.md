To perform your idea of creating a music room app using Django, you will need to have a good understanding of the following:

# prerequisites
1. Django framework: This is the backbone of your app and you should have a good understanding of how to build a web app using Django.
2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You will need to build the front-end of your app and you should have a good understanding of these technologies.
3. Music APIs: You will need to choose a music API (e.g. Spotify, SoundCloud) to access the music and you should have a good understanding of how to use the API.
4. Web sockets: You will need to use web sockets to allow real-time communication between the room host and other users in the room.
5. Database design: You will need to design a database to store information about the rooms, users, and playlists.


# To Do
1. Design the user interface of your app
2. Set up a Django project and configure the music API
3. Design the database to store information about rooms, users, and playlists
4. Implement the functionality to create and join rooms
5. Implement the functionality for the room host to add songs to the playlist and for other users to listen to the songs
6. Use web sockets to allow real-time communication between the room host and other users in the room.
7. Test and debug your app to make sure it is working as expected.
